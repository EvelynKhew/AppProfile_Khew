9/14/21 - Tuesday
	17:40 - 20:05
	Back to the grind, trying out getting a photo from the gallery first. 
	Figured out how to upload photo from gallery and have it displayed. Now need to learn how to pass between activities. 
	Image now gets sent to the main page from activity_change_profile_image.xml, but it doesn't show up. 
	It shows up now! (20:00)
	Added some tests to make sure everything runs smoothly. 
	Image doesn't stay forever; it will revert back to original image once a different field is updated. 

	20:10 - 20:37	
	Documenting code. 
	Found an issue where the user uploaded image doesn't stay long term. It disappears as soon as the user visits a different page.
