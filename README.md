This app is built and tested using AndroidStudio. You can download the IDE through this link: https://developer.android.com/studio/install#mac

<h1>How to Run</h1>
To run the app, you will need an android virtual device (AVD), which you can set up through AndroidStudio. During my testing process, I used the Google Pixel 4 API 3 that was updated to Android 11.<br>

After the AVD is set up, you should just be able to hit run on any of the java files. AndroidStudio should build gradle, start your AVD, install the app into your AVD, and then the app should start.
