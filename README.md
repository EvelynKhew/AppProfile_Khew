This app is built and tested using AndroidStudio. You can download the IDE through this link: https://developer.android.com/studio/install#mac
To run the app, you will need an android virtual device (AVD), which you can set up through AndroidStudio. During my testing process, I used the Google Pixel [TODO] with the OS version [TODO: maybe it's R].

After the AVD is set up, you should just be able to hit run on any of the java files, and the app should run.
